Basic Terminologies:-

1. Shift : given a text string t and a pattern string p "Pattern P occurs"
with shift s in text t string if some condition is immpossible
(Bruteforce approach using shift. Comapre each index if not one match shift)
using shit we get the first index and len on p will give last index.

{More formally s will be initailly set to 0 but a string will be checked
 from (T[s+1, .... s + m]) and if it matches with p[m] then we can say 
 that string occurs}
